<!--Title: Introduction-->

<p>FubuValidation is a member of the Fubu-family of frameworks -- frameworks that aim to get out of your way by providing rich semantic models with powerful convention-driven operations. It aims to provide a convention-driven approach to validation while supporting more traditional approaches when needed.</p>

<blockquote>An important thing to note: FubuValidation is NOT coupled to FubuMVC. In fact, it maintains no references to the project.</blockquote>
